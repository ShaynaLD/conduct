# How to Link to the Code of Conduct

In general, link as follows:

> We are dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, and accessible experience.
> See the code of conduct at github.com/cville/conduct.

For media where space is limited, the project name "cville/conduct" is an indication that this is a code of conduct; simply link:

> [github.com/cville/conduct](https://github.com/cville/conduct)

Linking as above will provide the latest version of the code of conduct. Use these links to specify the latest revisions in the v1.x or v2.x branches:

* https://github.com/cville/conduct/tree/v1.x
* https://github.com/cville/conduct/tree/v2.x

To link to a more specific version, browse the releases here:

* https://github.com/cville/conduct/releases

For example, to link to v2.0 specifically:

* https://github.com/cville/conduct/tree/v2.0

The difference between v2.0 and v2.x is that v2.x will include any changes to the v2.x branch since v2.0.
