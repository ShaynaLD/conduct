## Inclusion

* Exercise consideration and respect in your writing, speech, and actions. You belong. So does the person next to you.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Acknowledge that a code of conduct is a tool to manage inclusive events; seemingly harmless comments can be perceived very differently by others.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community organizers if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
* Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.
